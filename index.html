        <p><span class="highlight">About Me:</span> I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas and am a first-generation Hispanic pursuing a degree away from home. I enjoy to run, spend time with family and friends, work on my programming skills, and explore the world of game development.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Past Internship Experience:</span> I just conlcuded this past summer as a Systems Engineer Intern at Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages, successfully implementing a water conservation project that limits the facilities daily water usage to under 250,000 gallons of water.
            Working alongside two other interns and two project managers, I not only learned the importance of communication skills and taking initiative, but on how to be detail-oriented when it comes to performing tasks to help reach a common goal.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Leadership Experience:</span> I also currently hold two leadership positions as a Student Mentor for SEEK (Student Engineers Educating Kids) and as a Fundraising Chair for SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers). These positions play a pivotal role in my every day life as they continue to help me work on my leadership skills and allow me to showcase some of my expertise outside the classroom in my communities. 
            Some of these capabilities include decision making, adaptability, creativity, active listening, and problem-solving skills. </p>
